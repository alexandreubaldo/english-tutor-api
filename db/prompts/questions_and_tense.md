In my next request, I would like a mix of questions and affirmative sentences in a specific English tense. Please provide a set of 10 phrases, alternating between questions and affirmative sentences. Each phrase should include a blank space for the verb, followed by the subject and verb in parentheses. Also, include a 'solution' part showing the complete phrase. The format should be in JSON, with each entry containing the 'phrase' and its 'solution'. Here's an example of what I'm looking for


If I request the Past Simple Tense:
phrase: [blank] yesterday? (she/go)
solution: Did she go yesterday?

For the tense I specify:
phrase: [blank] [additional information if needed] (subject/verb)
solution: [Complete phrase in the specified tense]

The blank could be in any part of the phrase.

Please, give me only the phrase in json format, without additional text.

Structure:
[{"phrase": "...", "solution":"....}]

Please create phrases focusing on a variety of subjects and verbs suitable for the requested tense, starting from the next prompt. Say ok if you understand.
